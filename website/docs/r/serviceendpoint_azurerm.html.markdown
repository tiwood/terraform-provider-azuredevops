## Requirements (Manual AzureRM Service Endpoint)
Before to create a service end point in Azure DevOps, you need to create a Service Principal in your Azure subscription.

For detailed steps to create a service principal with Azure cli see the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)

## Example Usage

### Manual AzureRM Service Endpoint

```hcl
resource "azuredevops_project" "project" {
  project_name       = "Sample Project"
  visibility         = "private"
  version_control    = "Git"
  work_item_template = "Agile"
}

resource "azuredevops_serviceendpoint_azurerm" "endpointazure" {
  project_id                = azuredevops_project.project.id
  service_endpoint_name     = "TestServiceRM"
  credentials{
    serviceprincipalid      = "xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx"
    serviceprincipalkey  = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  }
  azurerm_spn_tenantid      = "xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxxx"
  azurerm_subscription_id   = "xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx"
  azurerm_subscription_name = "Microsoft Azure DEMO"
}
```

### Automatic AzureRM Service Endpoint
